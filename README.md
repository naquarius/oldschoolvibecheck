## Local development (Next.js scaffold)

I added a minimal Next.js app scaffold to this repository. To run it locally:

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

If you prefer the new App Router (`app/`) or TypeScript, tell me and I can convert the scaffold.
